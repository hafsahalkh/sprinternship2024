# Emerging Diverse Talent Survey Project

## Purpose

The purpose of this project was to delve into the perspectives of emerging diverse talent within the fields of computer sciences, software engineering, and data science. Our primary goals were to:
- Understand the drivers that attract and retain individuals in these professions.
- Gather insights into the experiences and challenges faced by diverse talent in these fields.
- Provide actionable data to inform strategies for improving diversity and inclusion in technology roles.

## Project Overview

Over the course of three weeks, our team at LexisNexis Risk Solutions developed and executed a comprehensive survey project using a suite of tools including Typeform, PowerBI, PythonSQL, and Fabric. The project involved several key phases:

### 1. Survey Design and Implementation
- **Survey Design:** We designed a detailed survey to capture a wide range of perspectives from diverse talent in computer sciences, software engineering, and data science.
- **Platform:** The survey was deployed using Typeform to ensure an engaging and user-friendly experience for respondents.

### 2. Data Extraction and API Development
- **API Creation:** We employed PythonSQL and Fabric to create an API that automated the extraction of survey results from Typeform.
- **Data Handling:** This API ensured that the data retrieval process was efficient, accurate, and seamless.

### 3. Data Analysis and Visualization
- **Data Processing:** Using PythonSQL, we processed and cleaned the extracted data to prepare it for analysis.
- **Dashboard Development:** Leveraging PowerBI, we developed a dynamic dashboard to visualize the survey findings, providing in-depth insights into the key drivers and challenges for diverse talent in the tech industry.

## Impact and Outcomes

The outcomes of our project have significant implications for both emerging talent and organizational stakeholders:
- **For Emerging Talent:** The insights gathered can help inform potential career paths, highlight common challenges, and provide a voice to diverse groups within the tech industry.
- **For Stakeholders:** The data and visualizations offer valuable information to guide strategies aimed at attracting, retaining, and supporting diverse talent in technology roles.

## Skills Gained

Through this project, team members gained practical experience in:
- Survey design and implementation using Typeform.
- API development and data extraction using PythonSQL and Fabric.
- Data processing and analysis.
